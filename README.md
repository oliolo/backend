# backend

Make sure to have python 3.11.0 version installed where you want to run the backend.

## Setting up the backend

In our React repository there is a .bat file called SetupBack&frontend.bat that will setup and install all that is needed to start the backend server.

## Setting up Amazon S3

In the settings.py file there are 3 variables that you need to set up to get the Amazon S3 storage to work. 
This can be done by either adding the 2 keys and the bucket name in the settings.py or by setting up enviroment variables for them.
